# Microsoft ML Samples

Here are samples that will get you started with MicrosoftML. 

1. 101: These set of samples are a great starting point to get introducted to MicrosoftML
2. Pretrained Models: Pretrained models are models that use complex algorithms such as Deep Neural Networks and jumpstarts the ability to do machine learning quickly.

We will continue to add samples over time.
