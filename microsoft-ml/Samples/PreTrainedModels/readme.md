#Pretrained Models
The first set of pretrained models were launched in the Microsoft R 9.1 release in April 2017. The key concept behind pretrained models is that there is no longer need to train complex models for specific domains.The outputs of these pretrained models can be used as is for specific scenarios, or as additional relevant data for training more targeted models.

As of this writing, we have pretrained models in 2 main domains:
1. Image Analytics
2. Text Analytics

With ongoing releases, we will continue to add pretrained models to these domains, and also add models in new domains.
