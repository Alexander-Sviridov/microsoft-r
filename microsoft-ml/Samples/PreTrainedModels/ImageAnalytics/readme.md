# Pretrained Models: Image Analytics
Machine driven Image Analytics, such as image recognition, is a hard problem. As of this writing, Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is today the state-of-the-art approach used for image recognition. 

However, it takes a lot of expertise and effort to create and setup DNNs for training models for automated image recognition.

Pretrained image analytics models are models that have been already created and trained for use out of the box. These models are good-enough to get started into the domain of machine learning based image analytics.
